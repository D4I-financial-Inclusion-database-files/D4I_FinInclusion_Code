```{r}
stufff <- read.csv(file = "C:/Users/hamza/Desktop/D4I Project/regressionstufff.csv", header = TRUE, skipNul = TRUE)
#help("read.table")
```

## Creating Loess Row

This part make the Loess function based on days and cases, then puts it into R

```{r}
mod <- loess(stufff$cases ~ stufff$days, span = 0.5)
stufff$Loess <- mod$fitted
```

## Including Plots

This is the visual of the plot
```{r}
plot(stufff$days, stufff$cases)
lines(predict(mod), col = "red", lwd = 3)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
